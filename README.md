Abstract
The Real-Time Public Transport Tracking System is a web-based application designed to provide commuters with live updates on the location and movement of buses and other public transport vehicles. This system is particularly aimed at small to medium-sized cities where traditional tracking infrastructure is limited.

Problem Statement
In many small and mid-sized cities, commuters face challenges in tracking public transport vehicles in real time. Passengers often experience long waiting times, missed buses, and uncertainty about arrival times due to the lack of a reliable tracking system.

This results in inefficient travel planning, overcrowding at bus stops, and frustration among commuters. Traditional tracking solutions are either expensive or unavailable for smaller cities, making it difficult for local authorities to provide timely information to passengers.
Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by commuters in small and mid-sized cities, the Real-Time Public Transport Tracking System proposes a web-based application that displays the live locations of buses and other public transport vehicles on an interactive map.
Users can:
1.	Reduced Waiting Time
2.	Improved Travel Planning
3.	Convenience and Reliability
4.	Safety and Awareness
5.	Accessibility
Objectives
1.	Provide Live Tracking
2.	Display Estimated Arrival Times (ETA)
3.	Improve Commuter Convenience
4.	Enhance Route Visibility
5.	Develop a User-Friendly Interface
6.	Scalable for Future Integration
Modules/Futures
1.	Interactive Map Module
2.	Bus Location Tracking
3.	Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
4.	Responsive User Interface
5.	Route and Stop Information
6.	Real-Time Updates
7.	Modular and Scalable Design

User Flow: Open homepage → select stations → search → view results → toggle theme → footer links.
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, high-contrast text, semantic HTM Future Scope
Live Backend Integration: Connect with GPS-enabled buses for real-time tracking and updates.
Mobile App Development: Create apps for passengers and drivers with push notifications and bus alerts.
ETA Prediction & Analytics: Use AI/ML to provide accurate arrival times and optimize routes.
Multi-City & Multi-Transport Support: Expand to include buses, metro, and other public transport across cities.
Expected Impact
Better Commuter Experience: Real-time tracking reduces waiting times and travel uncertainty.
Efficient Transport Management: Authorities can monitor buses and optimize routes effectively.
Encourages Public Transport Use: Reliable information promotes bus usage, reducing traffic congestion.
Supports Smart Urban Mobility: Scalable system can be expanded to multiple cities and transport modes.
Conclusion
The Real-Time Public Transport Tracking System provides a practical, efficient, and user-friendly solution for commuters and transport authorities. By displaying live bus locations, route information, and estimated arrival times, the system improves travel planning, reduces waiting times, and enhances overall public transport efficiency. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend ensures accessibility and responsiveness, while the modular design allows future integration with backend services, mobile apps, and smart city initiatives. This project has the potential to encourage public transport usage, optimize urban mobility, and support sustainable commuting in small and mid-sized cities.
